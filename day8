'''
Write a python function, find_correct() which accepts a dictionary and returns a list as per the rules mentioned below.
The input dictionary will contain correct spelling of a word as key and the spelling provided by a contestant as the value.

The function should identify the degree of correctness as mentioned below:
CORRECT, if it is an exact match
ALMOST CORRECT, if no more than 2 letters are wrong
WRONG, if more than 2 letters are wrong or if length (correct spelling versus spelling given by contestant) mismatches.

and return a list containing the number of CORRECT answers, number of ALMOST CORRECT answers and number of WRONG answers. 
Assume that the words contain only uppercase letters and the maximum word length is 10.

Sample Input                                             Expected Output

{"THEIR": "THEIR", "BUSINESS": "BISINESS",
"WINDOWS":"WINDMILL","WERE":"WEAR","SAMPLE":"SAMPLE"}         [2, 2, 1]

'''
Care hospital wants to know the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients. 
Assume that the patient id of the patient along with the medical speciality visited by the patient is stored in a list. 
The details of the medical specialities are stored in a dictionary as follows:
{
"P":"Pediatrics",
"O":"Orthopedics",
"E":"ENT"
} 

Write a function to find the medical speciality visited by the maximum number of patients and return the name of the speciality.
Note: 
Assume that there is always only one medical speciality which is visited by maximum number of patients.
Perform case sensitive string comparison wherever necessary.

Sample Input                                    Expected Output

[101,P,102,O,302,P,305,P]                       Pediatrics

Write python function, sms_encoding() which accepts a sentence and converts it 
into an abbreviated sentence to be sent as SMS and returns the abbreviated sentence. 

Rules are as follows: 
a. Spaces are to be retained as is 
b. Each word should be encoded separately

If a word has only vowels then retain the word as is

If a word has a consonant (at least 1) then retain only those consonants

Note: Assume that the sentence would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.

Sample Input                                Expected Output
